# 2D Endless Runner Game (Java)

## Overview
This project is a **2D endless runner game** developed in Java, demonstrating object-oriented programming concept, game physics, and interactive design. The game challenges players to navigate a continuously moving track while avoiding obstacles, collecting power-ups, and surviving as long as possible.

## Features
- **Endless Gameplay:** The game runs indefinitely until all player lives are lost.
- **Dynamic Obstacles:**
  - **Cones** - Colliding with a cone reduces one life.
  - **Spikes** - Colliding with a spike reduces two lives.
- **Extra Lives:** Randomly placed on the track, allowing players to extend gameplay.
- **Speed Boosters:** Increase the car's speed temporarily when triggered.
- **Scoring System:** Players earn one point for every second survived.
- **Simple Controls:** The car or track moves forward automatically, with only left (`A`) and right (`D`) movement required.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds:** The background textures change every 100 points to maintain visual interest.

## Controls
- **A Key:** Move the car to the left.
- **D Key:** Move the car to the right.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** (Core programming language)
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles**
- **Game Physics & Collision Detection**
- **Graphics Rendering** for dynamic textures and animations
